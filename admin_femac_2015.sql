It&#8217;s sloppy at best, misleading at worst.</p>\n<p>First, some background. WordPress is under a license called the GPL, which basically says you can do whatever you like with the software, but if you distribute changes or create derivative works they also need to be under the GPL. Think of it like a Creative Commons Sharealike license.</p>\n<p>In the past people weren&#8217;t sure if themes for WordPress were derivative works and needed to be GPL. <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2009/07/themes-are-gpl-too/">In 2009 we got an outside legal opinion that cleared up the matter</a> saying that the PHP in themes definitely had to be GPL, and for CSS and images it was optional. Basically everyone in the WP community went fully GPL, sometimes called 100% GPL, for all the files required to run their theme (PHP, JS, CSS, artwork). The predicted theme apocalypse and death of WordPress didn&#8217;t happen and in fact both theme shops and WordPress flourished, and best of all users had all the same freedoms from their themes as they got from WordPress. It was controversial at the time, but I think history has reflected well on the approach the WP community took.</p>\n<p>As I said the PHP has to be GPL, the other stuff can be something else &#8212; many people started to use the term &#8220;split license&#8221; or &#8220;split GPL&#8221; to describe this. The problem, especially with the latter, is it leaves out the most important information. &#8220;Split GPL&#8221; doesn&#8217;t say whether the theme is violating WordPress&#8217; license or not (maybe it&#8217;s proprietary PHP and GPL CSS), and more importantly doesn&#8217;t say what the non-GPL stuff is, which is the part you need to worry about! It also makes it sound like a split license is a thing, when all it really means is there are different licenses for different parts of the work. If something has a &#8220;split license&#8221; you have no idea what restrictions or freedoms it provides.</p>\n<p>If someone decides to have different licenses for different parts of a theme they ship in one package, it&#8217;s probably worth taking a few extra words to spell out what the rights and restrictions are, like &#8220;GPL PHP, and a restrictive proprietary license for all other elements included with the theme.&#8221; This is really important because if you&#8217;re a smart WordPress consumer you should avoid proprietary software, there is always a GPL alternative that <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html">gives you the rights and freedoms you deserve</a>, and probably is from a nicer person who is more in line with the philosophy of the rest of WordPress. Vote with your pocketbook, buy GPL software!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 21 Jul 2015 20:55:12 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"Matt";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:1;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:94:"WPTavern: Shortcake Bakery Plugin Offers a Suite of Useful Shortcodes for WordPress Publishers";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=46896";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:104:"http://wptavern.com/shortcake-bakery-plugin-offers-a-suite-of-useful-shortcodes-for-wordpress-publishers";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4116:"<a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/baker.jpg"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/baker.jpg?resize=1024%2C516" alt="photo credit: Panettiere - (license)" class="size-full wp-image-46899" /></a>photo credit: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/27505428@N06/16282512996">Panettiere</a> &#8211; <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/">(license)</a>\n<p>In March, the <a href="http://wptavern.com/shortcake-is-now-a-wordpress-feature-plugin" target="_blank">Shortcake project officially began its journey as a feature plugin</a> with regular meetings for contributors working to make it ready to propose for inclusion in WordPress core.

The commercial caching plugin for WordPress launched two years ago in the French market and <a href="http://blog.wp-rocket.me/2-years-reports-feedbacks/" target="_blank">opened its doors to international customers</a> last May.</p>\n<p>At that time, WP Rocket was entering unproven territory as the first major caching plugin to launch with a 100% commercial model. Could the plugin succeed in a market dominated by free caching solutions like <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/w3-total-cache/" target="_blank">W3 Total Cache</a> and <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-super-cache/" target="_blank">WP Super Cache</a>?</p>\n<p>WP Rocket has the numbers to prove that WordPress users are willing to pay for an easy-to-configure solution to site optimization. In February, the 100% bootstrapped company published a transparency report showing that the product was now active on 15,000+ websites and <a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-rocket-grows-from-0-to-35k-in-monthly-revenue" target="_blank">averaging $35K in monthly revenue</a>. Six months later, the plugin is now active on more than 32,000 websites. From July 2014 &#8211; July 2015, WP Rocket <a href="http://blog.wp-rocket.me/2-years-reports-feedbacks/" target="_blank">reports</a> that the company pulled in a total of $351,097 in revenue.</p>\n<a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/wprocket-2014-2015.jpg"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/wprocket-2014-2015.jpg?resize=629%2C525" alt="photo credit: WP Rocket</a." /></a>photo credit: <a href="http://blog.wp-rocket.me/2-years-reports-feedbacks/">WP Rocket</a>\n<p>WP Rocket has been successful in identifying ways to stand out among established competitors. During our <a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-rocket-launches-commercial-caching-plugin-for-wordpress" target="_blank">initial tests of the plugin</a>, we found that it took under a minute to configure caching for a small blogging site using its simple, basic settings panel. Without even touching the more advanced options, such as DNS prefetching and file exclusions, we were able to reduce the page size and load time by roughly 50%.</p>\n<p>Inspired by a recent three-month stay in San Francisco, WP Rocket developers and co-founders  Jonathan Buttigieg and Jean-Baptiste Marchand-Arvier are now working to diversify their product offerings.</p>\n<p>&#8220;WP Rocket will be one product among others from our startup and not the only one,&#8221; Marchand-Arvier said. &#8220;We want to have a portfolio of products and not depend on only one.&#8221;</p>\n<p>To that end, the company is dipping its toes into multiple potentially welcoming revenue streams, including plugins, themes, and SaaS.</p>\n<p>&#8220;For the past few months, Julio has been working on a security plugin,&#8221; Marchand-Arvier said. &#8220;This is going to be a great challenge for us as we experiment with a freemium model for the first time, and because there are great competitors in the space, like WordFence and iThemes Security.</p>\n<p>WP Rocket currently has a dedicated team working on <a href="https://imagify.io/" target="_blank">Imagify</a>, an image compression toolkit and their first SaaS venture. The company also plans to enter the theme market with its own shop.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We want to take on that huge challenge which will be very different compared to selling a plugin,&#8221; Marchand-Arvier said.</p>\n<p>WP Rocket&#8217;s founders believe that building a strong company culture will be one of the key factors to their continued success.</p>\n<p>&#8220;To work in a mostly remote team can create a lack of human connection,&#8221; Marchand-Arvier said. &#8220;That’s why we’ve decided to organize a ‘startup retreat’ every year.&#8221; This decision was inspired by the founders&#8217; 2014 trip to explore Silicon Valley, a pivotal event that changed the way they approached business in the WordPress ecosystem.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This [trip] transformed three guys who were selling a WordPress plugin into a Startup of eight people (today) with a strong company culture,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>If the success of WP Rocket&#8217;s caching plugin is any indication, WordPress users should be on the lookout for the company to bring a new twist into other existing product niches.

His public response revives a <a href="http://wordpress.tv/2010/07/15/mixergy-interview-pearson-mullenweg/">five-year old licensing disagreement</a>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think the most important place to start is by asking: Why would Automattic—a website software company with over $300 million in funding—buy thesis.com when I owned the trademark for Thesis in the website software space?&#8221; Pearson asked.</p>\n<p>In February 2013, Pearson started negotiations with a domain broker named Larry of GetYourDomain.com in an attempt to purchase thesis.com. He opened with an offer of $37,500 which he considered to be more than enough for an unused domain. After months of negotiating, the deal fell through.</p>\n<a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/email-matt.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-46845" src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/email-matt.png?resize=486%2C191" alt="Email shared by Pearson showing Mullenweg''s interest in the domain" /></a>Email shared by Pearson showing Mullenweg&#8217;s interest in the domain\n<p>&#8220;I didn’t see how Matt could justify buying the domain for $100,000. Because of my trademark, there was no way he could legally use the domain for Automattic, and therefore, I didn’t believe there was a reason for him to spend that much money,&#8221; Pearson said.</p>\n<p>Nine months after negotiations failed, Pearson received an email from Larry asking if he&#8217;d like to renegotiate since Mullenweg showed interest in the domain. Further negotiations went nowhere and Mullenweg won the domain for $100K.</p>\n<p>News of Mullenweg&#8217;s purchase didn&#8217;t reach the public until he replied to a question about WordPress&#8217; relationship with commercial theme providers at the 2014 State of the Word Q&amp;A. In his response, he encouraged the audience to visit Thesis.com. Notice Mullenweg&#8217;s delivery and how the crowd reacts to his announcement.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Pearson also accused Mullenweg of <a href="http://tsdr.uspto.gov/#caseNumber=4039583&caseType=US_REGISTRATION_NO&searchType=statusSearch">violating his trademark</a>.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Principles? Matt spent $100,000 to buy thesis.com—a domain in which he had no legitimate business interest—forwarded the domain to his property, and violated my trademark.</p>\n<p>This is ironic considering how vigilant Matt has been about protecting the WordPress trademark—especially as it <a href="http://wptavern.com/the-wordpress-foundation-sues-jeff-yablon-for-trademark-infringement">relates to domain names</a>.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Pearson goes on to describe his duty to protect to his trademark and the details of the UDRP Case Ruling, as well as the fallout regarding the court&#8217;s decision in Automattic&#8217;s favor.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It’s time for the community to ask itself if using $300 million in funding to purchase $100,000 domains, fund aggressive lawsuits, and fuel unending drama is properly representative of the WordPress project,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>Pearson admitted to &#8220;being a jerk&#8221; both in the post and the comments. This admission is based on his attitude and the way he presented himself in 2010 in the <a href="http://wordpress.tv/2010/07/15/mixergy-interview-pearson-mullenweg/">interview with Andrew Warner</a> on Mixergy. Mullenweg focused on the fact that Pearson changed the licensing structure of Thesis so that part of it is incompatible with the GPL:</p>\n<p>&#8220;So why do the exact same thing you did before, change your license to violate the GPL and take rights away from your users? And then litigate against someone else?&#8221; Mullenweg asked.</p>\n<p>He is referring to Thesis&#8217; <a href="http://diythemes.com/thesis/rtfm/software-license-agreement/">license agreement</a> customers agree to when they purchase the theme. The agreement has terms that take user freedoms away that GPL licensed software provides. Here are a few of terms in the agreement:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can’t sell, rent, or otherwise transfer the software to anyone else.</li>\n<li>The license provides you, and only you, with the rights to use the software for its intended purpose.</li>\n<li>Other than for educational purposes, any modification of the Thesis “core” is prohibited.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Mullenweg is well known as a zealous protector of the GPL and users&#8217; rights. However, Pearson and many others perceived his comments on licensing to be a distraction from the main issue.</p>\n<p>In responding to commenters on whether the issue is dead, he <a href="http://www.pearsonified.com/2015/07/truth-about-thesis-com.php#comment-1507944" target="_blank">said</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The issue isn’t dead — Chris went back on his word and re-changed his license to be 100% proprietary and violate the GPL, sneakily sometime in the past 5 years since the last time he did that. He also patented how themes work, and color pickers.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The patent Mullenweg is <a href="http://www.google.com/patents/US20140095982">referring to</a> was published in September of 2012. The patent describes systems, servers, and methods for managing websites using the Thesis software. One of the fears is that the patent is vague and closely describes how WordPress themes work in general, although Pearson claims the patent has <a href="http://www.pearsonified.com/2015/07/truth-about-thesis-com.php#comment-1507962">nothing to do with WordPress</a>.</p>\n<p>Pearson <a href="http://www.pearsonified.com/2015/07/truth-about-thesis-com.php#comment-1507962" target="_blank">clarified Thesis&#8217; new proprietary licensing</a>, which Mullenweg believes to be in violation of their agreement in 2010:</p>\n<blockquote><p>In October 2012, I released an all-new version of Thesis that carried the same name as the original (which had a split-GPL license), but that’s where the similarities stopped.</p>\n<p>The new Thesis is not a Theme—it is an operating system for templates and design. This system runs Skins and Boxes, which are similar to Themes and Plugins, but with a boatload of built-in efficiencies that Themes and Plugins cannot provide.</p>\n<p>Skins and Boxes carry MIT licenses, which are not only open source, but also easy for anyone to understand and use.</p>\n<p>There is nothing sneaky about the licensing structure that has been in place since October 2012. DIYthemes customers must agree to the proprietary licensing on the Thesis core before downloading and using the software.</p></blockquote>\n<p>After Mullenweg purchased the domain, he <a href="http://www.pearsonified.com/2015/07/truth-about-thesis-com.php#comment-1507947">received no personal communication from Pearson</a> on the issue until Automattic was hit with litigation. The litigation stems from Pearson trying to protect his trademark.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I don’t know the last time I got an email from Chris directly (3+ years?), and myself and Automattic didn’t hear anything from him before we got the litigation notice he was trying to seize the domain,&#8221; Mullenweg commented. &#8220;No questions, no concerns, no offer to resolve, no discussion, we were just hit with legal action out of the blue.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In a <a href="http://www.pearsonified.com/2015/07/truth-about-thesis-com.php#comment-1507959">comment published</a> on Pearson&#8217;s blog post, Mullenweg contends that Pearson is repeating the same mistake he made in 2010 by not licensing Thesis as GPL.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It doesn’t matter if you admit what you did was wrong in the past if you go and do the exact same thing again: violate the GPL, and make it worse by patenting common theme practices,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>Up until this point, Mullenweg has declined to comment directly on Automattic&#8217;s interest in purchasing thesis.com in the first place. There are a lot of forces at play, including patents, GPL adherence, trademarks, and domain names. This is a developing and complicated story that we&#8217;ll continue to keep our eyes on.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Sat, 18 Jul 2015 05:24:07 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:5;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:65:"WPTavern: New Feature Plugin Proposed: oEmbed for WordPress Posts";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=46826";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:74:"http://wptavern.com/new-feature-plugin-proposed-oembed-for-wordpress-posts";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2809:"<p>WordPress has a <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Embeds" target="_blank">whitelist</a> of 31 trusted sites from which users can oEmbed content, but one source is noticeably missing &#8211; WordPress itself.

Tackling <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/32522#comment:34" target="_blank">abuse of the feature</a> could also pose a significant challenge.</p>\n<p>The feature plugin is still in the early development stages and discussion regarding its implementation is ongoing.

Opening up the starter theme to be available for use with a variety of frontend frameworks means that the Roots community is utilizing a wide range of technologies for development.</p>\n<p>The new podcast was created to discuss WordPress and Roots development and will also explore general modern web development topics. The <a href="https://roots.io/radio0/" target="_blank">inaugural episode</a> introduces Roots team members, many of whom use WordPress and others who are more active outside of WordPress development.

Despite Prime Day&#8217;s humor-inspiring failure, consumer obsession with the online retail giant isn&#8217;t likely to wane anytime soon. In fact, the company reported that its &#8220;&#8216;<a href="http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=176060&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=2068090" target="_blank">Prime Day&#8217; peak order rates surpassed that of 2014’s Black Friday</a>&#8221; early in the day.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re a die hard Amazon shopper, you&#8217;ll probably continue on as if Prime Day never happened. Here&#8217;s how you can do something good for WordPress while you&#8217;re at it:</p>\n<p>The <a href="http://smile.amazon.com/" target="_blank">AmazonSmile Foundation</a> enables shoppers to support their favorite charitable organizations when making purchases, at no extra cost. If you select a charity, AmazonSmile will automatically donate 0.5% of the purchase price from your eligible purchases. The <a href="http://wordpressfoundation.org/" target="_blank">WordPress Foundation</a> is among the nearly one million organizations that you can support.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/amazon-wordpress-foundation.jpg"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/amazon-wordpress-foundation.jpg?resize=1025%2C479" alt="amazon-wordpress-foundation" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-46731" /></a></p>\n<p>To sign up, simply visit <a href="http://smile.amazon.com/" target="_blank">Smile.Amazon.com</a> and select the WordPress Foundation. You&#8217;ll be presented with options that will help you navigate to Smile.Amazon.com more conveniently the next time you shop. If you have already selected a charity and want to change it, you can visit your account settings to search and select a new organization.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/amazon-smile-change-charity.jpg"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/amazon-smile-change-charity.jpg?resize=877%2C492" alt="amazon-smile-change-charity" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-46735" /></a></p>\n<h3>What does the WordPress Foundation do?</h3>\n<p>Before you opt to support the <a href="http://wordpressfoundation.org/" target="_blank">WordPress Foundation</a>, it&#8217;s important to know what it&#8217;s all about. The 501(c)3 non-profit organization was established &#8220;to further the mission of the WordPress open source project: to democratize publishing through Open Source, GPL software.&#8221; Matt Mullenweg created the charity to ensure that future generations will have access to WordPress as the project&#8217;s leadership and contributor base continue to evolve. It also exists to protect the WordPress and WordCamp trademarks and logos.</p>\n<p>A large portion of donations to the foundation go towards subsidizing WordCamp expenses, including video production of presentations for WordCamp.tv. The foundation also <a href="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-foundation-to-foot-the-bill-for-meetup-com-organizer-dues" target="_blank">covers Meetup.com organizer dues</a> for those who run WordPress meetups. At the beginning of this year, the foundation <a href="http://wptavern.com/the-wordpress-foundation-creates-a-traveling-scholarship-in-memory-of-kim-parsell" target="_blank">created a new traveling scholarship for women attending WordCamp US</a>, in memory of Kim Parsell, a prolific WordPress contributor who passed away this year.</p>\n<p>When you support the WordPress Foundation, you are supporting a variety of community initiatives that help ensure the future of WordPress for years to come. Rose Goldman, who helps manage the foundation, recently set the organization up on AmazonSmile. So far, she said the donations from Amazon represent just a trickle of the budget, but that&#8217;s probably due to lack of awareness of AmazonSmile. If you haven&#8217;t yet selected a charity for automatic donations from <a href="http://smile.amazon.com/" target="_blank">AmazonSmile</a>, the WordPress Foundation is a worthy cause.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 16 Jul 2015 18:52:07 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:10;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:54:"WPTavern: What Should WordPress.tv Do with Old Videos?";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=46713";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:63:"http://wptavern.com/what-should-wordpress-tv-do-with-old-videos";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4208:"<a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/WordPressTVFeaturedImage.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-46739" src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/WordPressTVFeaturedImage.png?resize=666%2C254" alt="WordPress TV Featured Image" /></a>photo credit: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/30719244@N06/8648634062">tvs</a> &#8211; <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/">(license)</a>\n<p><a href="http://wordpress.tv/">WordPress.tv</a> launched in <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2009/01/wordpresstv/">January of 2009</a> and since then has become one of the largest repositories of information dedicated to WordPress. To put that in perspective, WordPress 2.8 and 2.9 were released the same year.</p>\n<p>However, with more than six years of content available, the team has run into a problem. On July 3rd, Brash Rebel, who helps manage WordPress.tv, <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/tv/2015/07/03/ui-for-outdated-content/">asked</a> if there should be a user interface for outdated content.</p>\n<blockquote><p>A reality we are now facing is the fact that the software we know and love has evolved and changed considerably over this time period, thus rendering much of the early content on this site no longer applicable to users of more current releases of WordPress. In <a href="https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/wptv/p1435856572000421">today’s TV team Slack meeting</a> the question was raised about how to properly address outdated, deprecated, no-longer-accurate content.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The first question considered is whether to keep or delete old content, specifically, videos in the <a href="http://wordpress.tv/category/how-to/">How To</a> category. Since so many people watch older tutorial style videos, the team decided that removing the content permanently from the site is not the best course of action. The other question considered is whether older presentations on specific subjects should be deleted.</p>\n<p>For example, the following two sessions are about the same subject but four years apart. The content in the 2015 video is more likely to match the Google Analytics experience of today.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href="http://wordpress.tv/2013/03/16/melinda-samson-workshop-google-analytics-101/">Melinda Samson: Google Analytics 101 Workshop (2011)</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://wordpress.tv/2015/05/16/david-bird-google-analytics-and-wordpress-for-beginners-2/">David Bird: Google Analytics and WordPress for Beginners (May, 2015)</a></li>\n</ol>\n<p>The team also discussed a variety of ideas on how to display information to viewers that they&#8217;re watching outdated content. These included, text prompts, information bars, links, and determining the best method to indicate videos don&#8217;t reflect the current WordPress experience.</p>\n<p>Rebel says the goal isn&#8217;t to strictly deal with the issue today, but also set a precedence for the future. As more WordCamps occur across the globe and more <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/tv/2015/06/16/do-you-screencast-or-make-video-tutorials-of-how-to-use-wordpress-wordpress-tv-wants-you/">screencasts</a> show up on WordPress.tv, the team needs to figure out a balance between displaying old content and making the most out of fresh content.</p>\n<h2>Mimic the Plugin Directory</h2>\n<p>I&#8217;m happy that the team won&#8217;t delete old videos. As someone who writes about WordPress everyday, the videos on WordPress.tv contain a wealth of knowledge.

It&#8217;s a basic console that fits right into the WordPress admin and allows you to explore the API, make small changes, and find out what your site is exposing.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This is a forked version of the WP.com console that myself and members of the Apollo team at Automattic worked on,&#8221; McCue told the Tavern. The console was converted in approximately four casual days, and McCue credits <a href="http://viewsource.beaucollins.com/" target="_blank">Beau Collins</a> for this, as he originally wrote the majority of the console for developers working on WordPress.com.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s pretty useful for exploring the API as a learning tool, but also for developers who are extending the API to get a sense of how their stuff fits in,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>The REST API Console plugin requires the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugin/rest-api/" target="_blank">WP REST API plugin</a> version 2.0 or later. You can find this on the <a href="https://github.com/WP-API/WP-API" target="_blank">GitHub project page</a> and version 2 should be up on WordPress.org within the next day or two. Once you have both plugins installed, the console is visible in the admin under <strong>Tools > Rest API Console</strong>.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/wp-rest-api-console-demo.jpg"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/wp-rest-api-console-demo.jpg?resize=829%2C236" alt="wp-rest-api-console-demo" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-46693" /></a></p>\n<p>You can actually make changes to your site using the console, so it&#8217;s advisable to install it on a local site and play with it there. While the GET requests can&#8217;t change anything, the other types can edit or delete posts (which would end up in your trash).</p>\n<p>The plugin can only connect to the local site you&#8217;re currently on and cannot access remote WordPress sites. McCue recommends using something like <a href="https://www.getpostman.com/" target="_blank">Postman</a> or <a href="http://luckymarmot.com/paw" target="_blank">Paw</a> if you want to play around with remote sites.</p>\n<p>In the future, he hopes to add more features and improve the plugin&#8217;s parameter documentation.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The older WordPress.com console had the ability to click through to links, so I&#8217;d like to re-add that at some point,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The parameter documentation and tooling hasn&#8217;t been fleshed out yet, but the plan is to do it eventually &#8211; we&#8217;re working on exposing more from the API itself, too.&#8221;</p>\n<p>If you want to tinker with the API but don&#8217;t have a local testing site handy, check out the live demo at <a href="http://demo.wp-api.org" target="_blank">demo.wp-api.org</a> where you can click around to explore. This will save you the trouble of installing the plugin, if you just want to try it out. Also, you can&#8217;t perform any destructive changes there. Version 2 of the WP REST API plugin should be available on WordPress.org within 24-48 hours.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 16 Jul 2015 00:31:45 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:13;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:106:"WPTavern: WordPress Theme Review Team Unanimously Approves Roadmap to Improve Directory and Review Process";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=46551";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:116:"http://wptavern.com/wordpress-theme-review-team-unanimously-approves-roadmap-to-improve-directory-and-review-process";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2613:"<p>The <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/themes/">Theme Review Team</a> has spent the last two months <a href="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-theme-review-team-seeks-feedback-on-the-review-process-themes-and-the-directory">collecting data from surveys</a> to discover common pain points people experience using the theme directory and going through the theme review process.

The groups include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Directory</li>\n<li>Documentation</li>\n<li>Tools</li>\n<li>Reviews and queues</li>\n<li>UX and research</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each group needs a point person who acts as the communication bridge between the group and Theme Review Team. Tammie Lister explains what the point person&#8217;s role is within a group.</p>\n<blockquote><p>This person will report weekly what is going on during the chats. They will also post on the make.blog each week about what is going on in each group. This should ensure we keep up communication and make sure things get done.</p></blockquote>\n<p>They&#8217;re not necessarily in charge of getting things done but rather, act as a facilitator to make sure the group stays on track.</p>\n<p>One part of the roadmap that I&#8217;m interested in is the possibility of a report button added to the theme directory to allow users to report themes. If this happens, it will be interesting to see how it&#8217;s used or abused and whether it adds any additional work load to the theme reviewers.</p>\n<p>The roadmap looks solid and shows the team is focused on improving several aspects of the Theme Directory. This is a great opportunity for new contributors to get involved with the project.

Founders Robbie Grabowski and Mike Driscoll launched the site with a commitment to produce themes that support the native customizer and keep plugin functionality separate while still being &#8220;plugin-friendly.&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href="https://modernthemes.net/wordpress-themes/proper-lite/" target="_blank">Proper Lite</a> is ModernThemes&#8217; latest release, created to be fully compatible with their new <a href="https://modernthemes.net/plugins/" target="_blank">library of free plugins</a> that add functionality like shortcodes, widgets, sidebars, services, testimonials, projects, etc.</p>\n<p>The theme features a fullscreen homepage hero section with multiple controls for customizing the background, text, and buttons.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/properlite_mockups.png"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/properlite_mockups.png?resize=1000%2C700" alt="properlite_mockups" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-46645" /></a></p>\n<p>Proper Lite was designed with a modular homepage layout that supports three flexible widget areas where you can drop in portfolio items, blogs, testimonials, or any other content you choose. This is one of the reasons why ModernThemes calls it their most flexible free theme to date.</p>\n<p>In addition to the default template, Proper Lite includes Homepage, Full Width, and Left Sidebar templates. It also has specific styling for various content blocks added from the plugin library, as you can see in the <a href="https://modernthemes.net/demo/?theme=properlite" target="_blank">live demo</a>.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/team-members.jpg"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/team-members.jpg?resize=926%2C897" alt="team-members" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-46654" /></a></p>\n<p>Proper Lite has an amazing array of controls included in the customizer. Users can easily adjust Google Fonts, logos and icons, nearly every color used in the theme, social media icons, a footer call-to-action, the number of columns in the widget areas, and much more. The theme was not created with a set, inflexible design. Versatility is one of its key features.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/proper-lite-customizer.png"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/proper-lite-customizer.png?resize=1025%2C426" alt="proper-lite-customizer" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-46659" /></a></p>\n<p>Proper Lite, like other themes from ModernThemes, has extensive <a href="https://modernthemes.net/proper-lite-documentation/" target="_blank">documentation</a> available on the website for every section included in the theme.

Developers are building niche social networks every day, but BuddyPress&#8217; appeal as a platform hinges on the availability of compelling and reliable third-party add-ons.</p>\n<p>Over the past couple of months, BuddyBoss has branched out into serving the LMS market with free BuddyPress integration plugins for <a href="http://www.learndash.com/" target="_blank">LearnDash</a> and <a href="http://www.woothemes.com/products/sensei/" target="_blank">Sensei</a>, two of WordPress&#8217; most popular LMS solutions. Both <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/buddypress-learndash/" target="_blank">BuddyPress for LearnDash</a> and <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/sensei-buddypress/" target="_blank">BuddyPress for Sensei</a> were created to work with any theme, but are also guaranteed to work seamlessly with BuddyBoss&#8217; new Social Learner theme.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/social-learner.png"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/social-learner.png?resize=1000%2C573" alt="social-learner" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-46620" /></a></p>\n<p>Both plugins have similar core feature sets that include the ability to create courses, lessons, quizzes, and tie it all in to BuddyPress activity, groups, and forums to create a social learning platform. Course managers can even introduce gamification into the learning process with open source <a href="http://badgeos.org/" target="_blank">BadgeOS</a> plugin integration.</p>\n<p>Social learning communities, like popular social goal or fitness tracking apps, bring a higher level of engagement by leveraging the people factor. An LMS powered by WordPress and BuddyPress provides students with the ability to connect to new friends, collaborate, send messages, earn badges &#8211; all activities that contribute to a higher level of motivation for learning and success.</p>\n<p>The idea is not new to BuddyPress, as the long-abandoned <a href="http://buddypress.coursewa.re/" target="_blank">BuddyPress Courseware</a> project brought a social aspect to e-learning nearly four years ago. However, it is difficult to maintain an LMS plugin that only works with BuddyPress, because it doesn&#8217;t have the benefit of contributions and testing from a larger community. BuddyBoss made a strategic move in building plugins that would bridge BuddyPress to extend existing LMS solutions that serve the larger WordPress market. Both newer alternatives are available for free on WordPress.org.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 14 Jul 2015 22:53:52 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:18;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:75:"WPTavern: Theme Translations and Language Packs are Coming to WordPress.org";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=46589";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:85:"http://wptavern.com/theme-translations-and-language-packs-are-coming-to-wordpress-org";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3610:"<a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/globe.jpg"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/globe.jpg?resize=1024%2C499" alt="photo credit: .

In <a href="http://wptavern.com/highlights-of-matt-mullenwegs-qa-session-at-wordcamp-europe-2015" target="_blank">Matt Mullenweg&#8217;s Q&amp;A at WordCamp Europe 2015</a>, he emphasized the importance of having better language support for themes and plugins and identified this as a high priority for continued improvements to WordPress.org.</p>\n<p>Today the WordPress meta team <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2015/07/14/theme-translations-on-wordpress-org/" target="_blank">announced</a> that theme translations will soon be available on WordPress.org at <a href="http://translate.wordpress.org" target="_blank">translate.wordpress.org</a>. Within the next few days or weeks, all active themes (those updated within the last two years) will have their strings imported.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This will involve importing ~1500 themes, which, combined, have about 315,000 total strings,&#8221; Sam Sidler said in the announcement. &#8220;After duplicates, the number drops to only 80,000 unique strings.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>Language Packs Will Reduce Download Sizes for Themes</h3>\n<p>Sidler outlined several advantages for theme authors who opt to manage translations on WordPress.org, including the community&#8217;s large network of contributing translators who currently maintain 140 locales on <a href="http://translate.wordpress.org" target="_blank">translate.wordpress.org</a>.</p>\n<p>The most exciting change is that themes hosted on WordPress.org will soon be able to take advantage of language packs. Theme authors will have the option to remove translations from their zip file in favor of allowing WordPress.org to deliver the language packs, resulting in smaller download sizes.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Eventually, we also plan to give priority to localized themes in localized directories; e.g., someone searching the Romanian theme directory will see Romanian themes prioritized over English-only themes,&#8221; Sidler said.</p>\n<p>The more languages a theme can be translated into, the greater its prominence in WordPress&#8217; language-specific theme directories. This should provide WordPress.org theme authors with a strong motivation to <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/handbook/rosetta/theme-plugin-directories/" target="_blank">work with the polyglots team</a> to get more translations. Theme authors can also request new translation editors to be added to polyglots, if they want to continue working with their own translators.</p>\n<p>Those who prefer to ship their own translations can continue to do so. Keeping the translation files in your zip package will essentially opt you out of language packs for those specific translations. If you need help adding support for translations and language packs, Sidler recommends Otto&#8217;s <a href="http://ottopress.com/2013/language-packs-101-prepwork/" target="_blank">Language Packs 101</a> tutorial in addition to the <a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/functionality/internationalization/" target="_blank">Theme Developer Handbook section on Internationalization</a>.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 14 Jul 2015 20:22:12 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:19;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:87:"WPTavern: The First 24hr Conference Devoted to the Genesis Framework Set for July 18-20";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=46565";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:97:"http://wptavern.com/the-first-24hr-conference-devoted-to-the-genesis-framework-set-for-july-19-20";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1461:"<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/GenesisCampFeaturedImage.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-46579" src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/GenesisCampFeaturedImage.png?resize=880%2C275" alt="Genesis Camp Featured Image" /></a><a href="http://genesis.camp/">Genesis Camp</a> is the first 24 hour conference dedicated to the Genesis framework by <a href="http://www.studiopress.com/">Studiopress</a>.

The embedded player automatically does the following, according to Meerkat&#8217;s documentation:</p>\n<blockquote><p>It will show your live stream if you’re live. If you’re not live, if will show your next upcoming stream. If you have no upcoming streams, it will display stats from your last stream. If you have not streamed yet, it will show your profile.</p></blockquote>\n<p>All you need is the Meerkat username to use the shortcode in its simplest form:</p>\n<p><code>[meerkat username="meerkatapi"]</code></p>\n<p>It also includes optional parameters for customizing the username, player type, participation, cover image, muted defaults, and debug settings. These parameters essentially let you customize everything available in the <a href="http://widgets.meerkatapp.co/embed" target="_blank">Meerkat embed code generator</a>.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/meerkat-customize-embedded-player.jpg"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/meerkat-customize-embedded-player.jpg?resize=746%2C515" alt="meerkat-customize-embedded-player" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-46532" /></a></p>\n<p>The shortcode can be embedded in posts or pages. Artiss plans to add a widget option soon, as the default player size seems to lend itself to display in a sidebar. I tested the plugin with WordPress 4.3 beta 2 and found that it works as advertised.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/meerkat-wordpress-plugin-example.jpg"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/meerkat-wordpress-plugin-example.jpg?resize=778%2C635" alt="meerkat-wordpress-plugin-example" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-46533" /></a></p>\n<p>At TechCrunch Disrupt in May 2015, Meerkat founder Ben Rubin reported that the service was <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/meerkat-has-nearly-2-million-users-2015-5" target="_blank">approaching nearly two million users</a>. Chances are that plenty of those users also have WordPress sites where they can gain more exposure for their streams.</p>\n<p>Artiss wanted to make it easy for anyone to embed a stream. He isn&#8217;t a Meerkat user himself but found that its API was easy to work with for embedding content.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t write it for myself but I thought putting the newly released embed function in a simple-to-use plugin for WordPress users would be useful,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I just happened to be working on <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/zingtree-embed/" target="_blank">Zingtree Embed plugin</a> at the same time, so it was quite simple to clone that and modify it for a different embed type.&#8221;</p>\n<p>If you want your fans and followers to be able to find your Meerkat stream on the web, download the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/meerkat/" target="_blank">Meerkat</a> embed plugin from the WordPress plugin directory. This will allow folks to join you live from your website, without having to use the app on their phones. The widget embed option should land in the next release.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 13 Jul 2015 19:47:17 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:24;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:95:"WPTavern: Envato Targeted by DDoS Attack, WordPress Theme Authors Report Major Decline in Sales";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=46485";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:104:"http://wptavern.com/envato-targeted-by-ddos-attack-wordpress-theme-authors-report-major-decline-in-sales";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6430:"<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/envato.jpg"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/envato.jpg?resize=697%2C314" alt="envato" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29973" /></a></p>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve attempted to access Themeforest or any other site on the <a href="http://www.envato.com/" target="_blank">Envato</a> network lately, you may have encountered some down time. The company <a href="http://inside.envato.com/denial-of-service-attacks-on-envato/" target="_blank">updated</a> customers and community members today, attributing the technical difficulties to a DDoS attack:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Since July 1, Envato has been the target of a sustained DDoS (distributed denial of service) attack. The attacker, whose motive and identity are unknown, has repeatedly flooded our servers with high levels of traffic, causing our services to be unavailable at various times.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The most recent outage happened over the weekend when Envato Market was down for three hours on Friday and one hour on Sunday. This is a significant chunk of time for a market that <a href="http://www.envato.com/2014" target="_blank">paid out $224 million dollars to its members in 2014</a>.</p>\n<p>The downtime has also impacted WordPress theme authors, who continue to dominate the Envato&#8217;s marketplace. According to Ben Chan, the company&#8217;s director of growth and revenue, 30 of the 31 sellers who make up the <a href="http://elite.envato.com/wall-of-fame/" target="_blank">Power Elite wall of fame</a> (selling $1 million+ worth of items) are WordPress product authors.</p>\n<p>The power of the WordPress economy on Envato is undeniable, but sales have taken a sharp decline in the past couple of months, even before the DDoS attack. According to PremiumWP, which cites reports from elite theme author Chris Robinson of Contempo and many others, <a href="http://www.premiumwp.com/themeforest-authors-report-50-70-drop-in-theme-sales/" target="_blank">sales have suddenly declined 50-70%</a>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Sales have declined over 70% starting from May with each passing day getting worse,&#8221; Robinson said in the <a href="http://themeforest.net/forums/thread/envato-are-youre-not-telling-us-something/185158" target="_blank">members&#8217; forum</a>. &#8220;I’ve also spoken with other elite authors explaining the same thing. One example going from $1500/day to $700 &#8211; sure that’s still a great deal of money BUT what the hell is happening?</p>\n<p>&#8220;This isn’t just one or maybe twenty authors, it is marketplace wide affecting everyone. A marketplace wide decline in sales of this magnitude doesn’t just happen due to vacations, or other buyer factors. Going through the years of sales data (since 2008) this has never happened, I’ve personally gone from $2-3000/week to less than $700/week…that’s insane!&#8221;</p>\n<p>With new authors and products entering the market every day, the market share for established authors is slowly diminishing, but members are not convinced that this is the sole cause of the sharp drop in sales.</p>\n<p>FinalDestiny of TeoThemes, another author whose sales are declining, blames the <a href="http://wptavern.com/envato-continues-to-rake-in-the-cash-from-wordpress-themes-packaged-as-complete-website-solutions" target="_blank">one-size-fits-all theme products</a> for gobbling up a greater slice of the market share.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Everybody is tired of these huge, monster multipurpose themes having the same price as normal themes, and that’s pretty much killing the marketplaces. But Envato couldn’t care less, as long as they get their share,&#8221; he <a href="http://themeforest.net/forums/thread/envato-are-youre-not-telling-us-something/185158?page=1&message_id=1303716#1303716" target="_blank">said</a>.</p>\n<p>In another <a href="http://themeforest.net/forums/thread/whats-wrong-with-sales-on-tf-/181436" target="_blank">thread</a>, which ended up getting locked, there are 27 pages of comments from users speculating about why their sales have been dropping. Members cite seasonal buying fluctuations, piracy, Themeforest&#8217;s recent drop in Google search rankings, VAT and hidden price additions on checkout, and unfair pricing advantages for monster themes that claim to do everything, among other possible causes.</p>\n<p>In one thread, titled &#8220;<a href="http://themeforest.net/forums/thread/more-than-50-sales-drop-for-most-of-the-authors-does-tf-care-for-authors/182262" target="_blank">More than 50% sales drop for most of the authors. Does TF care for Authors?</a>&#8220;, an Envato community officer offered the following comment:</p>\n<blockquote><p>We don’t really give sales updates over the forums other than to say your sales can go up and down for a multitude of reasons. Try not to assume the sky is falling every time the USA has a long weekend :) We have fast and slow periods throughout the year same as any business, and your portfolio will no doubt have peaks and valleys as well.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This kind of generic reply has left theme authors scratching their heads, despite multiple threads in the forums popping up with concerns from those who are alarmed by the sudden drop. Many WordPress theme authors depend on Themeforest as their primary source of income. In one <a href="http://themeforest.net/forums/thread/more-than-50-sales-drop-for-most-of-the-authors-does-tf-care-for-authors/182262?page=3&message_id=1291143#1291143" target="_blank">reply</a>, the Aligator Studio seller sums up their concerns and frustration with the inability to convince Envato of the unusual circumstances that are affecting large numbers of sellers:</p>\n<blockquote><p>We are not talking about valleys and peaks, we’re talking about a general traffic and sales fall, from New Year until now, especially after April. We’re not talking about regular ups and downs (sometimes steeper, sometimes not), due to longer weekends, summer holidays, and general and the usual stuff happening here in the last couple of years.</p>\n<p>It’s not a sky falling – it’s inability to pay our bills, we’re not fanatics that foresee the end of the world.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Envato has yet to provide an official statement about the marketplace-wide decline in sales, apart from recognizing the network&#8217;s unavailability due to the recent DDoS attack.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 13 Jul 2015 16:42:22 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:25;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:50:"Matt: Neil Gaiman Speech at University of the Arts";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:21:"http://ma.tt/?p=45241";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:46:"http://ma.tt/2015/07/neil-gaiman-commencement/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:78:"<p>&#8220;Make good art.&#8221;</p>\n<p><span class="embed-youtube"></span></p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Sun, 12 Jul 2015 20:15:37 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"Matt";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:26;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:23:"Matt: WordCamp Scranton";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:21:"http://ma.tt/?p=45234";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:39:"http://ma.tt/2015/07/wordcamp-scranton/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:800:"<p>As was just announced, I&#8217;m going to make a not-surprise appearance at WordCamp Scranton next Saturday.

Let&#8217;s face it, your social media posts are scattered all over the web.</p>\n<p><a href="https://github.com/ademilter/socialcrumbs" target="_blank">SocialCrumbs</a> is a non-traditional, niche WordPress theme that aggregates all of your social media activity into one stream with the help of <a href="https://ifttt.com/" target="_blank">IFTTT</a> recipes. The theme was created by <a href="http://ademilter.com/" target="_blank">Adam Ilter</a>, a user interface designer and developer living in Istanbul. He designed a Pinterest-style display to output the social posts brought in by IFTTT. The masonry grid is responsive and colorful with posts featuring icons for each social network.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/socialcrumbs-screenshot.jpg"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/socialcrumbs-screenshot.jpg?resize=1025%2C745" alt="socialcrumbs-screenshot" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-46451" /></a></p>\n<p>You can view a live demo of SocialCrumbs at <a href="http://adem.social/" target="_blank">adem.social</a>.</p>\n<p>In order to use the theme, you need to sign up for IFTTT and set up recipes for all the social accounts you want to include in the stream. The theme&#8217;s readme.txt files includes a list of 19 <a href="https://github.com/ademilter/socialcrumbs#recipes" target="_blank">recipes</a> that Ilter has pre-configured, with a checklist of many more planned.</p>\n<p>Certain networks have multiple options. For example, you can choose to include Twitter tweets and/or favorites:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>twitter-tweet-write <a href="https://ifttt.com/recipes/189363" target="_blank">https://ifttt.com/recipes/189363</a></li>\n<li>twitter-tweet-favorite <a href="https://ifttt.com/recipes/189331" target="_blank">https://ifttt.com/recipes/189331</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>It can take up to 15 minutes for the content to appear in your theme after posting to the social network, as most IFTTT recipes check for new trigger data at that interval.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s important to note that this theme is hosted on GitHub, not officially supported, and is an example of a fun, experimental concept that relies on IFTTT. As such, it doesn&#8217;t includes a single post template but rather outputs as an index. SocialCrumbs is not yet capable of providing a comprehensive archive for social media posts, so it&#8217;s not a theme you would use if you intend to record all of your social activities for preservation.</p>\n<p>One might argue that this kind of functionality is better housed in a plugin. In that case you might want to take a look at the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/social-streams/" target="_blank">Social Streams</a> or <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-social-stream/" target="_blank">WP Social Stream</a> plugins on WordPress.org. WP Social Stream is based on <a href="https://github.com/christianv/jquery-lifestream" target="_blank">jQuery Lifestream</a>, as opposed to IFTTT. The methods of retrieving social posts vary from plugin to plugin, depending on how you want to fetch, display, and store that content.</p>\n<p>The most ideal use for the SocialCrumbs theme would be where you dedicate a subsite to its display, i.e. for showing social media posts surrounding an event or brand. If it was forked to include the ability to make the social media content searchable and sortable, SocialCrumbs would be even more useful beyond a simple visual display of activities.</p>\n<p>In its current state, the theme is a nice example of IFTTT and WordPress working together to create a configurable social stream that aggregates activity from multiple networks to a single page of your WordPress site.

UDRP requests are<span class="_Tgc"> a process established by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) for the resolution of disputes regarding the registration of internet domain names. </span></p>\n<h2>Automattic Wins Thesis.com</h2>\n<p>According to <a href="http://www.adrforum.com/domaindecisions/1613723.htm">findings by the UDRP panel</a>, in late 2014, a third-party who owned <a href="http://themeshaper.com/">Thesis.com</a> approached Automattic and Pearson to see if they were interested in buying the domain. Automattic won the domain by bidding $100K.</p>\n<p>Soon after winning the domain, Pearson filed a UDRP request with ICANN seeking relief requesting that the domain name be transferred from Automattic to himself. In June 2015, a three-member panel was appointed to review the case.</p>\n<p>According to <a href="https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/rules-be-2012-02-25-en">rule number five</a> set forth by ICANN for the UDRP process, Respondents have 20 days to respond to the Provider. If a Respondent does not submit a response, in the absence of exceptional circumstances, the Panel decides the dispute based upon the complaint.</p>\n<p>In a controversial move, the Panel accepted and reviewed Automattic&#8217;s late response.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The Panel notes that Respondent failed to submit its response within the requisite time period, failing to comply with ICANN Rule #5.  In its discretion, the Panel considered Respondent’s arguments in the late filed Response in the interest of justice.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Pearson satisfied two of the three burdens imposed under the Policy in order for the Panel to order transfer of a domain name from the entity registering it. Pearson failed to provide evidence that showed Thesis.com redirects to Themeshaper.com. In its response to the Panel, Automattic admitted to using the domain in this way but it appears to have had no affect on the Panel&#8217;s decision.</p>\n<p>The Panel noted that if Complainant’s submissions are insufficient, it may request additional exhibits or information under Rule 12 but given the outcome, the Panel chose not to seek additional submissions.</p>\n<p>You can view the panel&#8217;s findings in <a href="http://www.adrforum.com/domaindecisions/1613723.htm">this public document.</a> The panel concluded that the Complainant (Pearson) failed to establish all three elements required under the ICANN Policy and that relief shall be denied.</p>\n<blockquote><p>A party must satisfy all three of the burdens imposed under the Policy in order for the Panel to order transfer of a domain name from the entity registering it. Here, Complainant failed to establish that Respondent registered and used the disputed domain name in bad faith.</p>\n<p><em>See Starwood Hotels &amp; Resorts Worldwide, Inc. v. Samjo CellTech.Ltd</em>, FA 406512 (Nat. Arb. Forum Mar. 9, 2005) (finding that the complainant failed to establish that respondent registered and used the disputed domain name in bad faith because mere assertions of bad faith are insufficient for a complainant to establish Policy ¶ 4(a)(iii)). Therefore, the Panel finds that Complainant failed to support its allegations under Policy ¶ 4(a)(iii) and finds for Respondent.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Therefore, Thesis.com is allowed to remain under Automattic&#8217;s ownership.</p>\n<h2>Automattic Strikes Back</h2>\n<p>On June 16th, Automattic struck back by <a href="http://ttabvue.uspto.gov/ttabvue/v?pno=92061714&pty=CAN&eno=1">filing a petition for cancellation</a> with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. In their petition, Automattic argues that the three trademarks owned by Pearson, DIYTHEMES, THESIS THEME, and THESIS, should be cancelled.</p>\n<a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/PetitionForCancellation.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-46431" src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/PetitionForCancellation.png?resize=704%2C721" alt="Petition for Cancellation" /></a>Petition for Cancellation\n<p>When questioned about the Thesis.com domain and petition to cancel Perason&#8217;s trademarks, Automattic responded with the following statement:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Chris Pearson tried to seize a domain Automattic owns through the UDRP process. As part of defending ourselves we have dug into the trademarks that were being claimed by the aggressor, as that was the basis of his claim.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;re happy the panel ruled in our favor. We think Thesis.com is a cool, generic .com that could be used for a variety of things. Just because you have a small WordPress theme doesn&#8217;t mean you have a right to seize generic English word .com domains.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I&#8217;ve reached out to Pearson for comment but have yet to receive a response.</p>\n<h2>Automattic&#8217;s Interest in Thesis.com Remains Unexplained</h2>\n<p>There are a lot of unanswered questions that need to be answered. For instance, why did Automattic participate in the bidding process for Thesis.com when it has nothing to do with WordPress.com or associated services?</p>\n<p>The turbulent history between <a href="http://wordpress.tv/2010/07/15/mixergy-interview-pearson-mullenweg/">Matt Mullenweg and Pearson in 2010</a> nearly resulted in a lawsuit over GPLv2 compliance. The statement from Automattic fails to clarify why the company pursued Pearson again years later by bidding on a domain relevant to his business, apart from stating that it&#8217;s &#8220;a cool generic.com&#8221;.

But at the latest <a href="https://buenosaires.wordcamp.org/2015/" target="_blank">WordCamp Buenos Aires</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/eliorivero" target="_blank">Elio Rivero</a> spoke about using the customizer in plugins, and I decided to give it a try instead of entering into debate. And you know what? I loved it!&#8221;</p>\n<p>Logghe was contracted to build a new WordPress site and was looking for an easy way to beautify WordPress&#8217; default emails. He thought that the customizer would be the best choice for the job. After a week of development, he created <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/email-templates/" target="_blank">Email Templates</a>, the first plugin to enhance WordPress email templates using the customizer.</p>\n<p>Email Templates can be accessed under the Appearance menu. The plugin creates customizer panels for editing the template, email header, footer, and settings. It even includes the ability to send a test email.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/email-templates-panels.jpg"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/email-templates-panels.jpg?resize=1014%2C638" alt="email-templates-panels" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-46399" /></a></p>\n<p>Adding a logo to the top of your email template is as easy as uploading an image. You can also customize the alignment, background color, and header text. The plugin includes panels for changing the &#8220;from name&#8221; and &#8220;from email&#8221;, footer text, and basic template styles.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/email-templates-logo.jpg"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/email-templates-logo.jpg?resize=1025%2C643" alt="email-templates-logo" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-46401" /></a></p>\n<p>After you finish your customizations, you can fire off a test email to see how the new template looks in your inbox. I tested the plugin and found that it works as advertised. Ordinarily, customizing WordPress&#8217; default email template is not something your average user would attempt to do. The <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/email-templates/" target="_blank">Email Templates</a> plugin makes this accessible to anyone.</p>\n<p>Building with the Customizer API has solidified Logghe&#8217;s belief in its potential for the future of WordPress. His example of live previewing email templates is a creative use of the API in the context of a plugin.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In my opinion, the customizer is the right choice for every design change,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The API is extremely easy to use and previewing changes on the fly makes it awesome for every end user.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It is just matter of time until the waters get calm and everyone migrates to it. In a year or so, editing your theme without the customizer is going to feel strange.&#8221;</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 09 Jul 2015 20:00:09 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:33;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:18:"Matt: 39 WordCamps";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:21:"http://ma.tt/?p=45228";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:34:"http://ma.tt/2015/07/39-wordcamps/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:220:"<p>There have been 39 WordCamps already so far this year, <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2015/07/wordcamps-update/">here are a bunch more interesting stats about WordCamps including a list of upcoming ones.</a>.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 09 Jul 2015 15:50:00 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"Matt";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:34;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:25:"Joseph: WordCamp SLC 2015";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:32:"https://josephscott.org/?p=13154";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:59:"https://josephscott.org/archives/2015/07/wordcamp-slc-2015/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1045:"<p><a href="https://slc.wordcamp.org/2015/">WordCamp Salt Lake City 2015</a> is coming September 12 at Washington Square ( 451 South State Street ).  <a href="https://slc.wordcamp.org/2015/tickets/">Tickets</a> are already on sale, only <a href="https://slc.wordcamp.org/2015/tickets/">$18 each</a>.

The application added real time communication for organizers, speakers, volunteers, sponsors, and the public. He found it to be a helpful addition to the WordCamp&#8217;s conference communication tools.</p>\n<p>As a new fan of the platform, Bisset decided to build an extension for those who want to use Slack with BuddyPress. <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/buddyslack/" target="_blank">BuddySlack</a> is his first plugin released on WordPress.org. The bare bones plugin will send a notice to Slack whenever an activity stream item is generated by any of the following core components:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Members</li>\n<li>Profiles</li>\n<li>Activity</li>\n<li>Groups</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The plugin allows you send your selected stream of activity posts to a particular channel, private group, or as a direct message to a user on your Slack team. It also includes an optional Slack settings panel within BuddyPress user profiles, allowing them to opt out of having their activities sent to Slack.</p>\n<p>In order to use the BuddySlack plugin, you&#8217;ll need to set up an incoming webhook via Slack, which can then be entered into the plugin&#8217;s settings panel.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/screenshot-1.png"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/screenshot-1.png?resize=1025%2C736" alt="screenshot-1" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-46379" /></a></p>\n<p>Bisset doesn&#8217;t plan on officially supporting the plugin but will add more features as time permits. He recognizes that it is currently somewhat limited, as it only supports sending activities for four default BuddyPress components. In the future, Bisset plans to expand it to support custom BP components as well as allow the user to customize the message sent to Slack.</p>\n<p>Ideally, the plugin would allow you to set certain trigger words so that you wouldn&#8217;t have to send the entire stream of activities from a selected component. Right now the best use for BuddySlack might be on a smaller social network that doesn&#8217;t have a constant stream of activities. For example, if the Groups component is used sparingly, sending group activity stream posts to a specific Slack channel could be useful. Being able to narrow it down to a specific group would be even better.</p>\n<p>The <a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-slack-plugin-sends-notifications-to-slack-based-on-events-triggered-in-wordpress" target="_blank">Slack plugin for WordPress</a> allows you to set up multiple integrations for sending notices to different channels.

The first post on the blog, written by Jon Chan, Stack Overflow&#8217;s developer evangelist, made no small amount of fanfare over <a href="http://blog.stackexchange.com/2015/07/how-we-built-our-blog/" target="_blank">migrating from WordPress to Jekyll</a>.</p>\n<p>Chan&#8217;s explanation of the team&#8217;s process cites a few curious reasons for their dissatisfaction with WordPress:</p>\n<blockquote><p>During the original proposal stage for the engineering blog, we also had a conversation about what engine we would use. At the time, all of our blogs were running WordPress&#8230;which we weren&#8217;t so happy about. It was very buggy, difficult to log in to, not very performant, and has caused our SRE team more than a few headaches. If we were really going to revamp the new company blog, it seemed like a lot of work to try and wrestle with our WordPress installation.</p></blockquote>\n<p>With a little bit of WordPress skill, these seem like easy complaints to resolve, especially given that Chan said the team was inspired by blogs like <a href="https://codeascraft.com/" target="_blank">Code as Craft</a> and <a href="http://oktrends.okcupid.com/" target="_blank">OkTrends</a>, both powered by WordPress. However, anti-WordPress sentiments continue to run high within the Stack Overflow community, which recently ranked the software as <a href="http://wptavern.com/stack-overflow-developer-survey-ranks-wordpress-as-the-3rd-most-dreaded-technology" target="_blank">the third most dreaded technology</a>.</p>\n<a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/get-rid-of-wp.png"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/get-rid-of-wp.png?resize=800%2C528" alt="photo credit: StackExchange Blog" class="size-full wp-image-46331" /></a>photo credit: <a href="http://blog.stackexchange.com/2015/07/how-we-built-our-blog/">StackExchange Blog</a>\n<p>After a great deal of consideration, the Stack Exchange team opted to use a static engine, eventually landing on <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a>. Chan outlined the advantages they perceived in the move:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Posts are in Markdown, something most of our company was familiar with</li>\n<li>Jekyll is just static site generation, so it&#8217;s much more performant</li>\n<li>Complete flexibility for front end work, no need to wrestle with templates</li>\n<li>Open source with a strong community, which we love</li>\n<li>Not WordPress or PHP</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Chan described the migration process, an endeavor that was fraught with obstacles. There is a <a href="http://wptavern.com/export-your-wordpress-blog-to-jekyll-with-one-click" target="_blank">Jekyll Exporter plugin</a> available to those who want to migrate their blogs over, but Stack Exchange opted to use the <a href="https://github.com/thomasf/exitwp" target="_blank">exitwp</a> tool to get them most of the way there.</p>\n<p>Since Jekyll doesn&#8217;t offer native support for comments, one of the biggest challenges in the migration was preserving that content and porting it into a new system. The Stack Exchange team decided to use <a href="https://disqus.com/" target="_blank">Disqus</a> for comments but were unable to properly migrate their existing comments and had to craft an alternative solution.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The worst part of this is how unsupported we were by the Disqus team,&#8221; Chan said. &#8220;We waited on the order of weeks for support responses and for over a month they went unresolved. Sending in official support tickets, emails, and posts on their Discuss forum went unnoticed.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Despite their unsatisfactory experience with Disqus and the fact that they have to sacrifice Stack Exchange login capabilities in order to use it, Chan said they will continue with it going forward.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re running a large, high profile blog on WordPress, it requires a certain level of expertise to customize themes and plugins and to ensure a high level of performance. It&#8217;s unclear whether or not the Stack Exchange team was lacking in expertise (based on some of the complaints cited) or simply unwilling to continue with WordPress after unsatisfactory experiences. No massive migration from one platform to another is ever going to be easy and bug-free, but Chan&#8217;s <a href="http://blog.stackexchange.com/2015/07/how-we-built-our-blog/" target="_blank">account</a> offers some valuable insight on how difficult it currently is to move from WordPress to Jekyll while preserving all of your content.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 08 Jul 2015 21:29:45 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:39;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:47:"WPTavern: HeroPress Ends Experiment With WPChat";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=46345";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:57:"http://wptavern.com/heropress-ends-experiment-with-wpchat";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2781:"<p>Since March of this year, <a href="http://heropress.com/">HeroPress</a> has published inspirational essays from people all over the world. Instead of allowing comments on the site itself, Topher DeRosia, founder of HeroPress, partnered with <a href="http://www.wpchat.com">WPChat</a> to host conversations for each essay. Unfortunately, many of the articles received little feedback.</p>\n<p>Starting this week, DeRosia is allowing contributing writers <a href="http://heropress.com/thoughts-on-comments/">to decide</a> whether they want comments enabled on their essay or not. &#8220;I made the decision to have no comments because I wanted the essays to stand alone, with one voice, that being the voice of the contributor.&#8221; DeRosia told the Tavern.</p>\n<p>Directing people to a third-party site is an odd way to generate a conversation around an article. DeRosia explains why he chose to host comments on WPChat, &#8220;I chose to attach WPChat to the project because it seemed like a good way for readers to express themselves without marring the surface of the essay itself.&#8221;</p>\n<a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/HeroPress3SurveyOnWPChat.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-46347" src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/HeroPress3SurveyOnWPChat.png?resize=816%2C594" alt="Example of a Conversation on WPChat About a HeroPress Essay" /></a>Example of a Conversation on WPChat\n<p><em><a href="https://wpchat.com/t/isolated-and-intrigued-heropress-essay-3/796">Isolated and intrigued</a></em> as well as <em><a href="https://wpchat.com/t/finding-stability-in-wordpress/893">Finding stability in WordPress</a></em> are two examples where great conversations took place on WPChat. However, these conversations are few and far between. &#8220;That leads me to believe there could be more quality input out there and people are simply not interested in making an extra account to comment,&#8221; said DeRosia.</p>\n<p>Contributors who choose to enable comments don&#8217;t need to worry about moderation. DeRosia will heavily moderate comments with a zero tolerance policy for trolls. As for WPChat hosting future conversations, DeRosia says, &#8220;I like WPChat but in this case, I simply don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s the tool for the job.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Comments connect authors to readers and are an <a href="http://wptavern.com/why-comments-still-matter">important part of the internet</a>. Sometimes, the feedback is better than the post itself. However, requiring readers to register to a forum to comment on articles hosted on a different site is too high of a roadblock. The commenting process should be as smooth and simple as possible. Enabling comments on HeroPress is a step in the right direction.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 08 Jul 2015 20:29:18 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:40;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:23:"Matt: Customer Success?";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:21:"http://ma.tt/?p=45217";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:38:"http://ma.tt/2015/07/customer-success/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:225:"<p>&#8220;Customer support, when done well, is a career.&#8221; Automattic&#8217;s support lead Andrew Spittle on <a href="http://andrewspittle.com/2015/07/02/customer-success/">customer success vs customer support</a>. </p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 08 Jul 2015 03:00:00 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"Matt";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:41;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:90:"WPTavern: BuiltWith Reports a 7% Increase in WordPress’ Usage from January – July 2015";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=46287";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:92:"http://wptavern.com/builtwith-reports-a-7-increase-in-wordpress-usage-from-january-july-2015";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4602:"<a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/chart.jpg"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/chart.jpg?resize=1025%2C511" alt="photo credit:  Luis Llerena" class="size-full wp-image-46313" /></a>photo credit:  <a href="https://stocksnap.io/photo/S3JE5YAMND">Luis Llerena</a>\n<p>BuiltWith, the popular service dedicated to monitoring internet technology trends and providing platform usage analytics, released its bi-annual <a href="http://blog.builtwith.com/2015/07/06/entire-internet-cms-usage-january-july-2015/" target="_blank">internet coverage report for CMS usage from January &#8211; July 2015</a>.

A<a href="http://wptavern.com/post-format-history-and-wordpress-3-6"> metabox with radio buttons</a> was added in WordPress 3.6 to expose the feature to users and allow them to easily select a format. Since WordPress 3.6 was released, there has been <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=accepted&status=assigned&status=closed&status=new&status=reopened&status=reviewing&component=Post+Formats&order=priority">little effort</a> to improve the feature.</p>\n<p>Morten Rand-Hendriksen <a href="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-trainer-morten-rand-hendriksen-on-common-pain-points-roadblocks-and-advice-for-new-users">teaches WordPress</a> to thousands of people through <a href="http://www.lynda.com/WordPress-tutorials/WordPress-Essential-Training/154417-2.html">Lynda.com</a>. After spending time writing training materials for post formats, Hendriksen was reminded of how much post formats shouldn&#8217;t be in WordPress core.</p>\n<p>He&#8217;s created a <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/32844">new ticket on trac</a> suggesting post formats be removed from WordPress and placed into a plugin similar to how the link manager and blogroll <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Links_Manager">were removed</a> in WordPress 3.5.</p>\n<blockquote><p>After the termination of Post Formats UI, it appears the feature has largely been left to pasture and implementation across themes is at best spotty and inconsistent. One example of this is how different Post Formats are treated in the default themes, culminating in the minimalist/absent inclusion in Twenty Fifteen.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Hendriksen lists six key arguments that come up when discussing the removal of post formats from WordPress:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Feature support is inconsistent across themes causing users to wonder why the panel and options appear and disappear when themes are switched.</li>\n<li>When implemented, behavior is inconsistent between themes causing a perception of arbitrary or broken behavior in the eyes of the user.</li>\n<li>Specification for what exactly each post format does is vague and ambiguous giving theme developers too much room to come up with arbitrary and non-standard behaviors that cause user confusion when themes are switched.</li>\n<li>The use case for Post Formats seems to have gone away or have been supplanted for the larger goal of making modular, Snowfall-like post editing available.</li>\n<li>Post Formats behavior can be mimicked by theme developers through the use of Categories or other custom taxonomies.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Applying the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle#In_software">80/20 rule</a> to software development, Hendriksen believes post formats is in the 20% range or lower. He ends the ticket by proposing post formats be moved into a feature plugin.</p>\n<p>This would allow it to be improved concurrently with WordPress and open up opportunities to experiment with different implementations and ideas. Alternatively, it could be abandoned if no interest is shown to improve it.</p>\n<h2>Move Post Formats to a Plugin</h2>\n<p>My opinion of Post Formats hasn&#8217;t changed since the <a href="http://wptavern.com/why-arent-post-formats-in-wordpress-more-popular">last time I wrote about them</a>. They&#8217;re still unpredictable, I don&#8217;t see many sites using them, and they&#8217;re tough to explain to new users.</p>\n<p>Considering post formats dramatically impact the presentation of content, it&#8217;s strange that the core team has not continually improved the feature after 3.6. By now, they should be rock solid. Instead, it&#8217;s a feature with no obvious future.</p>\n<p>Although you can leave a comment on this post, the best place to leave feedback is in this <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/32844">trac ticket</a>. It&#8217;s time WordPress core developers got involved with the conversation to let us know what they think about the future of post formats in WordPress.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 07 Jul 2015 18:00:26 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:43;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:87:"WPTavern: WordPress 4.3 Improves User Search and Turns Comments Off on Pages by Default";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=46238";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:97:"http://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-3-improves-user-search-and-turns-comments-off-on-pages-by-default";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4001:"<p><a href="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-3-beta-1-now-available-for-testing" target="_blank">WordPress 4.3 beta 1</a> was put into the hands of testers last week. Those who have been following 4.3 developments are already familiar with the major features headlining this release, ie. the new <a href="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-3-adds-new-site-icons-feature-and-a-text-editor-to-press-this" target="_blank">site icons</a>, <a href="http://wptavern.com/menu-customizer-officially-approved-for-merge-into-wordpress-4-3" target="_blank">menu management in the customizer</a>, and <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/32589" target="_blank">more secure passwords</a>. However, there are also a couple lesser-known improvements that will have a positive impact on millions of WordPress users.</p>\n<h4>Improved User Search</h4>\n<p>Searching for users in the admin is about to get much easier, thanks to work on a <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/27304" target="_blank">ticket</a> opened by John Blackbourn 16 months ago. He notes that &#8220;only the user_login (username) and user_nicename (sanitized username) fields are searched,&#8221; excluding the following more likely fields:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>First name</li>\n<li>Last name</li>\n<li>Nickname</li>\n<li>Display name</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This issue was especially problematic in large, multi-thousand member multisite installations where finding a user in the admin often meant knowing exactly what to query and then paging through results. WordPress 4.3 contributions from <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/mordauk" target="_blank">Pippin Williamson</a> and <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/wonderboymusic" target="_blank">Scott Taylor</a> make it possible to <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/32980" target="_blank">search by the user&#8217;s email, URL, and display name</a>.</p>\n<h4>Comments Turned Off on Pages by Default</h4>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/comments-off-on-pages-by-default.jpg"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/comments-off-on-pages-by-default.jpg?resize=962%2C323" alt="comments-off-on-pages-by-default" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-46275" /></a></p>\n<p>WordPress 4.3 will also bring a welcome change to turn off comments on pages by default. In the future when you create pages, you won&#8217;t have to remember to go into the discussion settings to disable comments. One might think this would be a simple little thing to change, but quite a bit of discussion has gone into crafting the best solution to the <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/31168" target="_blank">ticket</a> opened five months ago.</p>\n<p>This change also applies to all custom post types. Mel Choyce outlined the new behavior in a <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/07/06/comments-are-now-turned-off-on-pages-by-default/" target="_blank">post</a> on the make.wordpress.org/core blog:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Post registrations that don’t explicitly add support for comments will now default to comments being off on new posts of that type (before, they defaulted to on). Up until now, post type support for comments has only affected admin UI; a developer could omit comment support on registration but still allow comments to be posted. <strong>This is a change in behavior</strong>, and we will be closely monitoring its effects during beta. Moving to explicit support will allow core behavior to be more predictable and robust in the future, but we will always consider real-world usage.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The change also comes with a new function and a filter that you can use to restore the current behavior of comments to your post type, if necessary. More details and an example on how to use the filter are available on the make.wordpress.org/core announcement <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/07/06/comments-are-now-turned-off-on-pages-by-default/" target="_blank">post</a>.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 07 Jul 2015 05:07:42 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:44;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:20:"Matt: Why We Encrypt";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:21:"http://ma.tt/?p=45215";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:36:"http://ma.tt/2015/07/why-we-encrypt/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:172:"<p>From one of the best blogs on the internet, <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2015/06/why_we_encrypt.html">Bruce Schnier writes on Why We Encrypt</a>.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 07 Jul 2015 04:46:00 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"Matt";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:45;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:39:"Akismet: Akismet WordPress Plugin 3.1.3";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"http://blog.akismet.com/?p=1854";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:59:"http://blog.akismet.com/2015/07/06/akismet-3-1-3-wordpress/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1014:"<p>Version 3.1.3 of <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/akismet/">the Akismet plugin for WordPress</a> is now available.</p>\n<p>This update addresses an issue causing some users to see blank Akismet settings screens.

Despite the event taking place in the US in 2016, I asked Strebel if plans to host Pressnomics in Europe or even a branch of the conference are still on the table?</p>\n<blockquote><p>We are conversing with folks in Europe to try to make something happen in 2016, in addition to, Pressnomics 4 in Phoenix. Rather than ice everything until all details are final, we decided to swing and see if we can make both happen.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Tickets go on sale <strong>September 1st, 2015 at 10AM PST</strong>. Despite feedback from attendees that ticket prices should increase, event co-organizer Sally Strebel, says prices will remain roughly the same as last year.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I’ve been told by numerous people that we should increase the cost of tickets for this event and that they go to other conferences that cost more and return less value.</p>\n<p>Thank you for looking out for us and I truly value your opinion, however we have decided to keep costs essentially the same as last year because it’s not about the money. It’s about giving back. We look forward to growing our businesses together.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Companies immediately applied to be sponsors within minutes of receiving sponsorship information. Those companies include, GoDaddy, Envato, Sucuri, iThemes, Easy Digital Downloads, and more.</p>\n<p>I had the privilege <a href="http://wptavern.com/envato-stats-tips-for-getting-things-done-and-more-at-pressnomics-3">to attend Pressnomics 3</a> and it was by far one of the most unique WordPress conferences I&#8217;ve attended. Compared to WordCamps, the atmosphere is much different and you can tell speakers are more open and relaxed since sessions are not recorded.</p>\n<p>March is a great time of year to host a conference in Phoenix. If Pressnomics 3 is anything to go by, Pressnomics 4 will be amazing. If you have the opportunity to attend Pressnomics 4, I highly suggest doing so as it&#8217;s a memorable experience.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 06 Jul 2015 22:48:52 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:48;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:70:"WPTavern: PHP 4 Style Constructors Will Be Deprecated in WordPress 4.3";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=46222";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:80:"http://wptavern.com/php-4-style-constructors-will-be-deprecated-in-wordpress-4-3";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1730:"<p>PHP 4 style constructors are being deprecated in WordPress 4.3 to ease the transition to support PHP 7.

For those who were unable to attend, this session provides a glimpse into what WordPress&#8217; co-founder sees for the future of the software and the community.</p>\n<p>One of the most exciting parts of the video is where Mullenweg talks about the potential of WordPress.org to serve other languages and eventually expand avenues of core contribution to non-English speaking audiences.</p>\n<p>When asked what kind of contribution can be made to improve WordPress.org for Rosetta sites, themes, and plugins, Mullenweg replied:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Themes and plugins are undoubtedly the most important. To me, the next most important things are the Rosetta sites and having theme and plugin directories available on the Rosetta sites. There is actually a great example at <a href="https://ro.wordpress.org/" target="_blank">ro.wordpress.org</a>, which is the Romanian Rosetta site that shows both the potential and the problem:</p>\n<p>Now there are themes and plugins menu items there, which none of the Rosetta sites have had prior to this. But when you click on it you see mostly English in the plugin descriptions, even things like screenshots and tutorials.</p></blockquote>\n<p>He described these updates to WordPress.org as just a &#8220;hint of what could be amazing&#8221; one day. Mullenweg noted that despite Europe having 23+ recognized languages, attendees at the WordCamp were all speaking English. However, not all areas of the world are populated by people with bilingual capabilities.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I think it would be amazing to open up WordPress to have a first priority experience of the thousands of plugins and themes that are available for people who do not speak a word of English. Right now WordPress is just not accessible to that group. Luckily, over half the people in Europe are bilingual&#8230; In places where that&#8217;s a possibility, WordPress can still do well even though we don&#8217;t have a native experience in someone&#8217;s mother tongue.</p>\n<p>But English is only the third most popular language in the world and it&#8217;s not the fastest growing. There are huge audiences that I think would be an important part of the community. Someday I want it to be where, instead of things being translated from English to a different language, we&#8217;re getting core contributions translated from, say, Chinese or Hindi or Spanish, into English to be reviewed. We&#8217;re not looking to just how to translate plugins from English into other languages but vice versa. I think that will be when we&#8217;re successful.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In the same way that better language support opens up WordPress to a wider audience, Mullenweg believes that the customizer will open up the software for more non-technical users. During the Q&amp;A he shared his thoughts on the future of the customizer:</p>\n<blockquote><p>As we currently are working, the customizer is the way forward&#8230;It essentially removes the fear and disconnect between wp-admin and the front end of a site. It&#8217;s a bridge that gives people the confidence to make changes while seeing those changes in real time. The real time feedback and safety net of seeing that, and being able to undo and redo things, is incredibly empowering, particularly for non-technical users who don&#8217;t know how to dive into CSS or the code. I personally believe that the work on the customizer is some of the most important going on in the WordPress project right now.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In addition to building the feature in a way that is responsive to mobile devices, Mullenweg noted that the customizer currently falls short on desktop:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The customizer is, for lack of a better word, a narrow interface, because it needs to show your site in addition to the admin. I think we need to do a better job of making sure that interface scales up as well as down, meaning that if you do have the space or would like to make it fullscreen, that it is responsive, so that it enlarges into an interface that probably looks and works much like the current wp-admin interface for being a fullscreen experience for editing and modifying menus, widgets, colors, fonts, header images, site title, all the things that are key to the presentation of your site.</p></blockquote>\n<p>It is curious that the customizer is being pushed through to WordPress 4.3 without the ability to scale up gracefully. If the situation were reversed, where the feature was unfriendly to mobile users, it seems less likely that it would have been deemed ready for core. This illustrates the WordPress project&#8217;s strong emphasis on being positioned to attract mobile users.</p>\n<p>Mullenweg encouraged attendees to keep an eye on the customizer, because he believes it will do a much better job than Wix and Squarespace when it comes to providing a user-friendly way to customizer websites.</p>\n<p>The entirety of the 66-minute long Q&amp;A session is included in the video below. In addition to languages and the customizer, Mullenweg also answers questions about security, WordPress&#8217; minimum PHP version, the possibility of multilingual features in core, and the importance of building for mobile.</p>\n<p></p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 06 Jul 2015 16:39:07 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}s:4:"type";i:128;s:7:"headers";a:10:{s:6:"server";s:5:"nginx";s:4:"date";s:29:"Wed, 22 Jul 2015 01:24:28 GMT";s:12:"content-type";s:8:"text/xml";s:14:"content-length";s:6:"181937";s:10:"connection";s:5:"close";s:4:"vary";s:15:"Accept-Encoding";s:13:"last-modified";s:29:"Wed, 22 Jul 2015 01:00:18 GMT";s:15:"x-frame-options";s:10:"SAMEORIGIN";s:4:"x-nc";s:11:"HIT lax 249";s:13:"accept-ranges";s:5:"bytes";}s:5:"build";s:14:"20150707013150";}', 'no');
